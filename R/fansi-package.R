#' Details About Manipulation of Strings Containing Control Sequences
#'
#' Counterparts to R string manipulation functions that account for
#' the effects of ANSI text formatting control sequences.
#'
#' @section Control Characters and Sequences:
#'
#' Control characters and sequences are non-printing inline characters that can
#' be used to modify terminal display and behavior, for example by changing text
#' color or cursor position.
#'
#' We will refer to ANSI control characters and sequences as "_Control
#' Sequences_" hereafter.
#'
#' There are three types of _Control Sequences_ that `fansi` treats specially:
#'
#' * "C0" control characters, such as tabs and carriage returns (we include
#'   delete in this set, even though technically it is not part of it).
#' * Sequences starting in "ESC&#91;", also known as ANSI CSI sequences.
#' * Sequences starting in "ESC" and followed by something other than "&#91;".
#'
#' All of these are considered zero display-width for purposes of string width
#' calculations.
#'
#' _Control Sequences_ starting with ESC are assumed to be two characters
#' long (including the ESC) unless they are of the CSI variety, in which case
#' their length is computed as per the [ECMA-48
#' specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm).
#' There are non-CSI escape sequences that may be longer than two characters,
#' but `fansi` will (incorrectly) treat them as if they were two characters
#' long.
#'
#' In theory it is possible to encode _Control Sequences_ with a single
#' byte introducing character in the 0x40-0x5F range instead of the traditional
#' "ESC&#91;".  Since this is rare and it conflicts with UTF-8 encoding, we do
#' not support it.
#'
#' @section ANSI CSI SGR Control Sequences:
#'
#' **NOTE**: not all displays support ANSI CSI SGR sequences; run
#' [term_cap_test] to see whether your display supports them.
#'
#' ANSI CSI SGR Control Sequences are the subset of CSI sequences that can be
#' used to change text appearance (e.g. color).  These sequences begin with
#' "ESC&#91;" and end in "m".  `fansi` interprets these sequences and writes new
#' ones to the output strings in such a way that the original formatting is
#' preserved.  In most cases this should be transparent to the user.
#'
#' Occasionally there may be mismatches between how `fansi` and a display
#' interpret the CSI SGR sequences, which may produce display artifacts.  The
#' most likely source of artifacts are _Control Sequences_ that move
#' the cursor or change the display, or that `fansi` otherwise fails to
#' interpret, such as:
#'
#' * Unknown SGR substrings.
#' * "C0" control characters like tabs and carriage returns.
#' * Other escape sequences.
#'
#' Another possible source of problems is that different displays parse
#' and interpret control sequences differently.  The common CSI SGR sequences
#' that you are likely to encounter in formatted text tend to be treated
#' consistently, but less common ones are not.  `fansi` tries to hew by the
#' ECMA-48 specification **for CSI control sequences**, but not all terminals
#' do.
#'
#' The most likely source of problems will be 24-bit CSI SGR sequences.
#' For example, a 24-bit color sequence such as "ESC&#91;38;2;31;42;4" is a
#' single foreground color to a terminal that supports it, or separate
#' foreground, background, faint, and underline specifications for one that does
#' not.  To mitigate this particular problem you can tell `fansi` what your
#' terminal capabilities are via the `term.cap` parameter or the
#' "fansi.term.cap" global option, although `fansi` does try to detect them by
#' default.
#'
#' `fansi` will will warn if it encounters _Control Sequences_ that it cannot
#' interpret or that might conflict with terminal capabilities.  You can turn
#' off warnings via the `warn` parameter or via the "fansi.warn" global option.
#'
#' `fansi` can work around "C0" tab control characters by turning them into
#' spaces first with [tabs_as_spaces()] or with the `tabs.as.spaces` parameter
#' available in some of the `fansi` functions.
#'
#' We chose to interpret ANSI CSI SGR sequences because this reduces how
#' much string transcription we need to do during string manipulation.  If we do
#' not interpret the sequences then we need to record all of them from the
#' beginning of the string and prepend all the accumulated tags up to beginning
#' of a substring to the substring.  In many case the bulk of those accumulated
#' tags will be irrelevant as their effects will have been superseded by
#' subsequent tags.
#'
#' `fansi` assumes that ANSI CSI SGR sequences should be interpreted in
#' cumulative "Graphic Rendition Combination Mode".  This means new SGR
#' sequences add to rather than replace previous ones, although in some cases
#' the effect is the same as replacement (e.g. if you have a color active and
#' pick another one).
#'
#' @section Encodings / UTF-8:
#'
#' `fansi` will convert any non-ASCII strings to UTF-8 before processing them,
#' and `fansi` functions that return strings will return them encoded in UTF-8.
#' In some cases this will be different to what base R does.  For example,
#' `substr` re-encodes substrings to their original encoding.
#'
#' Interpretation of UTF-8 strings is intended to be consistent with base R.
#' There are three ways things may not work out exactly as desired:
#'
#' 1. `fansi`, despite its best intentions, handles a UTF-8 sequence differently
#'    to the way R does.
#' 2. R incorrectly handles a UTF-8 sequence.
#' 3. Your display incorrectly handles a UTF-8 sequence.
#'
#' These issues are most likely to occur with invalid UTF-8 sequences,
#' combining character sequences, and emoji.  For example, as of this writing R
#' (and the OSX terminal) consider emojis to be one wide characters, when in
#' reality they are two wide.  Do not expect the `fansi` width
#' calculations to to work correctly with strings containing emoji.
#'
#' Internally, `fansi` computes the width of every UTF-8 character sequence
#' outside of the ASCII range using the native `R_nchar` function.  This will
#' cause such characters to be processed slower than ASCII characters.
#' Additionally, `fansi` character width computations can differ from R width
#' computations despite the use of `R_nchar`. `fansi` always computes width for
#' each character individually, which assumes that the sum of the widths of each
#' character is equal to the width of a sequence.  However, it is theoretically
#' possible for a character sequence that forms a single grapheme to break that
#' assumption. In informal testing we have found this to be rare because in the
#' most common multi-character graphemes the trailing characters are computed as
#' zero width.
#'
#' As of R 3.4.0 `substr` appears to use UTF-8 character byte sizes as indicated
#' by the leading byte, irrespective of whether the subsequent bytes lead to a
#' valid sequence.  Additionally, UTF-8 byte sequences as long as 5 or 6 bytes
#' may be allowed, which is likely a holdover from older Unicode versions.
#' `fansi` mimics this behavior.  It is likely `substr` will start failing with
#' invalid UTF-8 byte sequences with R 3.6.0 (as per SVN r74488).  In general,
#' you should assume that `fansi` may not replicate base R exactly when there
#' are illegal UTF-8 sequences present.
#'
#' Our long term objective is to implement proper UTF-8 character width
#' computations, but for simplicity and also because R and our terminal do not
#' do it properly either we are deferring the issue for now.
#'
#' @section R 3.1 support:
#'
#' Nominally you can build and run this package in R 3.1.  It should mostly
#' work, but please be aware we do not run the test suite under that version of
#' R.  One key degraded capability is width computation of wide-display
#' characters.  Under early versions of R, `fansi` will assume that every
#' character has a display width of 1.
#'  Additionally, `fansi` may not always report malformed UTF-8
#' sequences as it usually does.  One exception to this is [nchar_ctl()] as
#' that is just a thin wrapper around `base::nchar`.
#'
#' @section Miscellaneous:
#'
#' The native code in this package assumes that all strings are NULL terminated
#' and no longer than (32 bit) INT_MAX (excluding the NULL).  This should be a
#' safe assumption since the code is designed to work with STRSXPs and CHRSXPs.
#' Behavior is undefined and probably bad if you somehow manage to provide to
#' `fansi` strings that do not adhere to these assumptions.

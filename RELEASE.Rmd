## Release Steps

[x] Coverage 100%

Make sure to check codecov as the algorithms are different (and better?) there.

[x] R CMD check
[x] winbuilder
[x] Other locale (e.g. 8859-15, not "latin1")

    LC_ALL=ca_FR.ISO8859-15 LANG=ca_FR.ISO8859-15 R CMD check

[x] Revdep, we just did `cliapp` and `downlit` manually.


Review the details of revdep: it claims everything is fine, but there are
several failures (could be b/c of 10 minute timeout?).  Also, it took ~10 hours
to do the revdeps for 26 packages; what is going on with that?  Possibly not
enough RAM causing us to hit swap?  Need more RAM for docker?

Revdepcheck relies on crancache, which hasn't been updated in a while.

[ ] CRAN policy

[ ] Review documentation
[x] Update DESCRIPTION / NEWS
[x] New README
[x] Re-render vignette

Compiled code issues (do these last as inevitably we end up making changes).

[x] Rchk (rhub)
[x] valgrind
[x] Clang UBSAN (Rhub)
[x] Clang ASAN (Rhub) (catches things GCCSAN does not).

Optional

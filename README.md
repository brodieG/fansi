Counterparts to R string manipulation functions that account for the
effects of ANSI text formatting control sequences.

Formatting Strings with Control Sequences
-----------------------------------------

Many terminals will recognize special sequences of characters in strings
and change display behavior as a result. For example, on my terminal the
sequences `"\033[3?m"` and `"\033[4?m"`, where `"?"` is a digit in 1-7,
change the foreground and background colors of text respectively:

    fansi <- "\033[30m\033[41mF\033[42mA\033[43mN\033[44mS\033[45mI\033[m"

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/extra/images/fansi-1.png)

This type of sequence is called an ANSI CSI SGR control sequence. Most
\*nix terminals support them, and newer versions of Windows and Rstudio
consoles do too. You can check whether your display supports them by
running `term_cap_test()`.

Whether the `fansi` functions behave as expected depends on many
factors, including how your particular display handles Control
Sequences. See `?fansi` for details, particularly if you are getting
unexpected results.

Manipulation of Formatted Strings
---------------------------------

ANSI control characters and sequences (*Control Sequences* hereafter)
break the relationship between byte/character position in a string and
display position. For example, to extract the “ANS” part of our colored
“FANSI”, we would need to carefully compute the character positions:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/extra/images/fansi-2.png)

With `fansi` we can select directly based on display position:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/extra/images/fansi-3.png)

If you look closely you’ll notice that the text color for the `substr`
version is wrong as the naive string extraction loses the
initial`"\033[37m"` that sets the foreground color. Additionally, the
color from the last letter bleeds out into the next line.

`fansi` Functions
-----------------

`fansi` provides counterparts to the following string functions:

-   `substr` (and `substr<-`)
-   `strsplit`
-   `strtrim`
-   `strwrap`
-   `nchar` / `nzchar`
-   `trimws`

These are drop-in replacements that behave (almost) identically to the
base counterparts, except for the *Control Sequence* awareness. There
are also utility functions such as `strip_ctl` to remove *Control
Sequences* and `has_ctl` to detect whether strings contain them.

Much of `fansi` is written in C so you should find performance of the
`fansi` functions to be slightly slower than the corresponding base
functions, with the exception that `strwrap_ctl` is much faster.
Operations involving `type = "width"` will be slower still. We have
prioritized convenience and safety over raw speed in the C code, but
unless your code is primarily engaged in string manipulation `fansi`
should be fast enough to keep attention away from itself.

Width Based Substrings
----------------------

`fansi` also includes improved versions of some of those functions, such
as `substr2_ctl` which allows for width based substrings:

    "\uFF2D" # Full Width M
    ## [1] "Ｍ"
    nchar("\uFF2D", type='width')
    ## [1] 2
    "\uFF37" # Full Width W
    ## [1] "Ｗ"
    nchar("\uFF37", type='width')
    ## [1] 2
    raw <- strrep("\uFF2D\uFF37", 50)
    wrapped <- strwrap2_ctl(paste0("\033[45m", raw), 41, wrap.always=TRUE)

    writeLines(wrapped)
    [45mＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷ[0m
    [45mＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷＭＷ[0m

    pizza.grin <- strrep(sprintf("\033[46m%s\033[m", "\U1F355\U1F600"), 3)
    writeLines(pizza.grin)
    [46m🍕😀[m[46m🍕😀[m[46m🍕😀[m
    pg.width <- nchar_ctl(pizza.grin, type='width')
    substr2_ctl(wrapped, type='width', 15, 15 + pg.width - 1) <- pizza.grin
    writeLines(wrapped)
    [45mＭＷＭＷＭＷＭ[0m[46m🍕😀[m[46m🍕😀[m[46m🍕😀[0m[45mＷＭＷＭＷＭＷ[0m

`fansi` width calculations account for graphemes, including combining
emoji:

    emo <- c(
      "\U1F468",
      "\U1F468\U1F3FD",
      "\U1F468\U1F3FD\u200D\U1F9B3",
      "\U1F468\u200D\U1F469\u200D\U1F467\u200D\U1F466"
    )
    writeLines(
      paste(
        emo,
        paste("base:", nchar(emo, type='width')),
        paste("fansi:", nchar_ctl(emo, type='width'))
    ) )
    ## 👨 base: 2 fansi: 2
    ## 👨🏽 base: 4 fansi: 2
    ## 👨🏽‍🦳 base: 6 fansi: 2
    ## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 base: 8 fansi: 2

HTML Translation
----------------

You can translate ANSI CSI SGR formatted strings into their HTML
counterparts with `to_html`:

Rmarkdown
---------

It is possible to set `knitr` hooks such that R output that contains
ANSI CSI SGR is automatically converted to the HTML formatted equivalent
and displayed as intended. See the vignette for details.
[vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/doc/sgr-in-rmd.html)

Most of the examples in this README are CSI SGR translated into HTML.

Installation
------------

This package is available on CRAN:

    install.packages('fansi')

It has no runtime dependencies.

For the development version use
`remotes::install_github('brodieg/fansi@development')` or:

    f.dl <- tempfile()
    f.uz <- tempfile()
    github.url <- 'https://github.com/brodieG/fansi/archive/development.zip'
    download.file(github.url, f.dl)
    unzip(f.dl, exdir=f.uz)
    install.packages(file.path(f.uz, 'fansi-development'), repos=NULL, type='source')
    unlink(c(f.dl, f.uz))

There is no guarantee that development versions are stable or even
working. The master branch typically mirrors CRAN and should be stable.
